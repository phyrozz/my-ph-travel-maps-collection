# My Philippine Provincial Travel Maps Collection

This **web app** contains a bunch of provincial maps from the Philippines that let's you show your travel status for you to share. You can play around with the map by clicking on each city/municipality then choosing which travel status fits on that place.

**More provincial maps coming soon!**

## Different Travel Status
When you select a travel status for a municipality, it adds a certain point to the **Level** counter based on what status you picked. The more places you've stayed, for example, the higher your level is on the map.

Here's a breakdown on the travel statuses:

| Travel Status    | Level |
|      :---:       | :---: |
| Lived There      | 5     |
| Stayed There     | 4     |
| Visited There    | 3     |
| Alighted There   | 2     |
| Passed There     | 1     |
| Never Been There | 0     |

## How to share my app?

You can save your map after setting travel statuses by clicking on the `Save Map as Image` button. This will let you save your map as a `.jpg` image for you to share on social media.

This project was inspired by [philippine-map-app](https://github.com/OSSPhilippines/philippine-map-app) so feel free to support their project as well!

**Happy travels!**
